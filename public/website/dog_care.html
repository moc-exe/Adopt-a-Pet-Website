            <h3>Dog Care Tips!</h3>    
            <strong>Regular Exercise</strong>
            Make sure your dog gets enough physical activity each day to maintain a healthy weight and stimulate their mind. 
            This can include walks, playtime, and interactive toys.
            <br>
            <br>   
            <strong>Balanced diet</strong>
            Feed your dog a well-balanced diet that is appropriate for their age, size, and activity level. 
            Consult with your veterinarian to determine the best food for your dog's specific needs.
            <br>
            <br> 
            <strong>Grooming</strong>
            Depending on your dog's breed, they may require regular grooming to keep their coat healthy and free of mats. 
            Brushing their teeth, trimming their nails, and cleaning their ears are also important aspects of grooming.
